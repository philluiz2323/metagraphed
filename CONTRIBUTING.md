# Contributing to Metagraphed

Metagraphed is the Bittensor subnet integration registry — every subnet, metagraphed. This is the backend: a Cloudflare Worker API plus Node build scripts. **JSON Schema is the canonical contract** → OpenAPI → typed clients. Generated artifacts under `public/metagraph/` are projections of reviewed source, never hand-authored truth.

Live: [metagraph.sh](https://metagraph.sh) · API [api.metagraph.sh](https://api.metagraph.sh) · License AGPL-3.0 (Apache-2.0 client SDKs)

Two kinds of contribution, two paths:

- **Code / schema changes** → normal feature PR, run the gates below.
- **Community data** → add a surface to one subnet file, see [Community submissions](#community-submissions).

## Setup & gates

Use Node 22.

```bash
npm install
npm test
npm run validate
npm run build
```

`npm run validate` runs schema, API, and OpenAPI checks. For a full local data pipeline run, use `npm run pipeline:check`. Match focused checks to what you touch (`npm run validate:schemas`, `validate:api`, `validate:openapi`, `worker:test`) rather than running everything.

## Schema-first rule

The contract is generated, so you never edit it by hand:

1. Edit the source under `schemas/` or `schemas/components/`.
2. Run `npm run build` to regenerate `openapi.json` and the types/clients.
3. **Commit the regenerated artifacts in the same PR.**

Skipping the rebuild trips `validate:contract-drift` in CI. Schemas are the source of truth; everything downstream follows.

## Where to start

- **Enrich a subnet** (the best first PR) — we track one scoped task per subnet under the [surface-enrichment epic #427](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/issues/427). Browse [`good first issue`](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/labels/good%20first%20issue) + [`help wanted`](https://github.com/JSONbored/metagraphed/labels/help%20wanted): pick a subnet, find its real public API / OpenAPI / data artifact, and add it as a surface on the subnet's file ([Community submissions](#community-submissions) below). Each issue links the exact `surface:add` command.
- **Data gaps** — generate the current curation queue: `npm run curation:brief` (add `-- --limit 20` for more, `-- --json` for machine-readable). Start with profile-light subnets: directory-only entries, missing websites or source repos, public APIs with no OpenAPI metadata yet. See [`docs/curation-playbook.md`](docs/curation-playbook.md).

## Community submissions

Surfaces live in **one file per subnet**: `registry/subnets/<slug>.json` → its `surfaces[]` array. A community contribution **adds a surface to that one file** — `npm run surface:add` writes it with `authority: "community"` and `review.state: "community-submitted"`. There is no per-surface candidate file anymore (recreating `registry/candidates/community/*.json` is rejected by CI), so you can't farm one surface per PR: **one subnet = one file = one PR.**

> Change **only** the one `registry/subnets/<slug>.json` — no generated artifacts. First-time provider? Add `registry/providers/community/<slug>.json` in the same PR (`npm run provider:new`); provider identity still gets reviewed before it's trusted.

Add a surface locally — three steps:

```bash
# 1. Find the provider slug for the team/operator behind this surface.
#    (No match? Register one in the same PR with `npm run provider:new`.)
npm run providers:list

# 2. Append the surface to the subnet's file with a REAL --provider slug (a
#    placeholder like "community" is not a registered provider and fails validation).
npm run surface:add -- \
  --netuid 7 --kind docs \
  --url https://docs.example.com \
  --source-url https://github.com/example/project \
  --provider <provider-slug> --submitted-by <github-login> --write

# 3. Check it before pushing — a fast local pre-check (schema + provider slug +
#    review-state + real subnet name) without the full build (CI runs full validate).
npm run validate:surface -- registry/subnets/<slug>.json
```

> New subnet with no file yet? `npm run subnet:new -- --netuid <n> --name "<Real Name>" --write` first — a real `--name` is required (placeholder on-chain identities like "Team TBC" are rejected) — then add your surface to it.

A good surface PR is small: one public `url`, one `source_url` proving the claim, the right `kind`, all on the subnet's single file. Auto-review kinds: `docs`, `website`, `source-repo`, `dashboard`, `openapi`, `subnet-api`, `sse`, `data-artifact`, `sdk`, `example`.

**Higher-trust kinds** (base-layer `subtensor-rpc`/`subtensor-wss`/`archive` endpoints, authenticated or paid APIs, unknown providers, identity disputes) are welcome too — the autonomous reviewer scrutinizes identity/evidence harder and, when in doubt, closes or escalates rather than merging. Make the proof airtight (an independent `source_url` proving ownership).

**Hard boundaries:**

- Health, uptime, latency, incidents, and pool eligibility are **probe-derived only** — never hand-set them (or a surface's `verification`). The build's prober owns them.
- No secrets, PATs, wallet paths, private URLs, or validator-local data.
- Don't invent API/status surfaces a subnet doesn't publish.
- Schema-valid ≠ accepted. The review gate makes the final call.

**Accepted vs rejected at a glance** — the visible checklist (the final merge decision is the review gate's):

| ✅ Tends to get accepted                                                                                          | ❌ Gets closed / routed to manual                                                                    |

| `authority: community` + `review.state: community-submitted`, an auto-review `kind`, an active netuid, a provider | A surface the subnet already exposes — duplicate                                                     |
| `auth_required: false`, `public_safe: true`                                                                       | Secrets/PATs/wallet paths, private/localhost URLs, unproven ownership, or a recreated candidate file |

Callable surface with documented limits? Add an optional structured `rate_limit` — `{ requests, window, burst?, scope?, cost_notes? }` (`requests` + `window` required) — so agents and SDKs can pace calls. It's integration-only: metagraphed never enforces it and it doesn't feed completeness.
