// The one boundary in this codebase that touches @polkadot/extension-dapp (#5236,
// native-staking epic #5229, wallet standard locked by docs/adr/0018). Everything in
// this file is written so that no @polkadot/* code can ever be reached during SSR:
//
//   - @polkadot/util-crypto (a transitive dep of extension-dapp) auto-triggers WASM
//     init as an IMPORT-TIME side effect, not gated behind calling any function — so
//     even a top-level `import { web3Enable } from "@polkadot/extension-dapp"` would
//     be unsafe in an SSR bundle regardless of whether the functions are called.
//   - The fix: every function below that touches the package does so via a dynamic
//     `import()` INSIDE the function body, after a `typeof window === "undefined"`
//     early return. React SSR never executes event handlers or the bodies of
//     `useEffect` callbacks, so as long as callers only invoke these from one of
//     those (never from a component's render body), the dynamic import is never
//     reached during server rendering — this holds independent of how the Nitro/
//     Cloudflare Workers build bundles the eventually-imported package.
//   - `hasInjectedWallet()` needs no import at all — it only reads window.injectedWeb3,
//     which every compliant extension injects synchronously on page load — so the
//     "no extension installed" UI state can render without ever loading the
//     @polkadot/extension-dapp chunk.
//
// `import type` below is compile-time only and erased entirely by the TypeScript
// compiler — it emits no runtime import statement, so it costs nothing and carries
// zero SSR risk.
