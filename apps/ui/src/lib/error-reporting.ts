/**
 * Centralized error-reporting seam for React error boundaries.
 *
 * This is the single chokepoint a real telemetry backend is wired into:
 * boundaries call `reportError` and never touch `console.error` or a vendor SDK
 * directly.
 *
 * Sinks, in order, all best-effort:
 *  1. Sentry — enabled whenever a DSN is available. `@sentry/browser` is
 *     loaded via a DYNAMIC import so it costs zero bundle bytes when the DSN
 *     is unset (the import is tree-shaken / never reached). Tagged with a
 *     `release` (Cloudflare Workers Builds' own commit SHA, bridged in at
 *     build time via vite.config.ts's `define` -- see vite.config.ts's own
 *     comment) and `environment` (production/development from Vite's own
 *     `import.meta.env.PROD`), so a regression can be traced to the deploy
 *     that introduced it. Source maps for this release are uploaded by
 *     `@sentry/vite-plugin` (also wired in vite.config.ts), gated on
 *     `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` being set -- absent everywhere except a production
 *     Cloudflare Workers Build that has it configured (a real Sentry API
 *     token, unlike the DSN below, so it can't have a code-level default
 *     the same way -- sourcemap upload stays opt-in until a maintainer sets
 *     it as a Workers Builds dashboard build variable).
 *  2. PostHog (metagraphed#7759) — a second, PARALLEL sink, not a
 *     replacement; enabled whenever `VITE_POSTHOG_PROJECT_TOKEN` is
 *     configured (see analytics.ts). Reuses analytics.ts's own
 *     `captureException`, which shares the SAME lazily-loaded `posthog-js`
 *     instance web analytics already manages -- this file never touches
 *     `posthog-js` directly or triggers a second init. Release correlation
 *     for PostHog works differently than Sentry's `release` property: it's
 *     inferred at read time from the chunk IDs `@posthog/rollup-plugin`
 *     injects into the built JS at upload time (vite.config.ts), not
 *     something passed at capture time -- so there's no per-call release tag
 *     to set here, unlike the Sentry sink above.
 *  3. Lovable capture channel — best-effort, no-op outside the Lovable editor.
 *  4. `console.error` in dev so the boundary + context are always greppable
 *     locally.
 *
 * DSN resolution mirrors DEFAULT_API_BASE's own convention
 * (src/lib/metagraphed/config.ts): `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` overrides when a build
 * sets it (e.g. a future Workers Builds dashboard config), otherwise falls
 * back to the real "metagraphed" project DSN -- safe to hardcode since a
 * Sentry DSN is designed to be public/embeddable in client JS (see
 * scripts/observability.ts's own comment on the same point). The fallback
 * only applies to production builds (`import.meta.env.PROD`); `vite dev`
 * stays silent by default so local debugging doesn't mix into production
 * error tracking, matching this module's pre-existing "no eager Sentry load
 * unless configured" intent.
