/**
 * Centralized PostHog web-analytics + error-tracking + session-replay seam
 * (metagraphed#7760, #7759, #7761).
 *
 * Single chokepoint for client-side product analytics, exception reporting,
 * AND session replay: the app calls `initAnalytics()`/`capturePageview()`/
 * `captureEvent()`/`captureException()` and never touches `posthog-js`
 * directly elsewhere. Session replay has no separate exported function --
 * it's configured once in `loadPostHog`'s `session_recording` block below
 * and otherwise runs itself (posthog-js's own recorder), except for the
 * exception-linked force-record call inside `captureException`.
 * `captureException` is called from error-reporting.ts's `reportError` -- a
 * second, parallel sink alongside the existing Sentry one there, sharing
 * THIS module's one `posthog-js` instance rather than each maintaining its
 * own. Additive alongside the existing self-hosted Umami tracker
 * (src/server.ts) and Sentry while parity is proven -- see the
 * consolidation epic (metagraphed#7757) for the decommission plan.
 *
 * `posthog-js` is loaded via a DYNAMIC import, mirroring error-reporting.ts's
 * exact Sentry-loading pattern: this keeps it out of the initial client
 * bundle the CI bundle-size-budget gate measures (that check only counts the
 * entry's STATIC-import closure -- dynamic `import()` chunks are explicitly
 * excluded, confirmed against .github/workflows/validate.yml's own "Bundle
 * size budget" step), and -- just as importantly -- means self-hosters /
 * local dev / PR CI with no token configured pay zero bytes for a library
 * they never use, the same "zero cost when unconfigured" guarantee every
 * other telemetry integration in this codebase already provides.
 *
 * Proxied first-party through this origin (POSTHOG_API_HOST below, served by
 * src/server.ts's handleAnalyticsProxy) -- the same ad-blocker-resilience +
 * no-extra-DNS-handshake rationale the existing Umami proxy already
 * documents, and PostHog's own Cloudflare-proxy guide's stated purpose
 * ("hides PostHog's domains from ad blockers").
 *
 * Autocapture/pageview capture via the `defaults` option is intentionally
 * NOT relied on for pageviews (`capture_pageview: false`): this is a
 * client-side-routed SPA, so the one pageview `defaults` would auto-fire on
 * init only covers the very first load. Every navigation (including the
 * first) is captured explicitly instead, via TanStack Router's `onResolved`
 * event (wired in routes/__root.tsx) -- one predictable code path rather
 * than mixing automatic-for-the-first-load with manual-for-the-rest.
 * Autocapture of clicks/inputs is left to `defaults`' own recommended
 * behavior.
