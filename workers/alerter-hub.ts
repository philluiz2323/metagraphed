// #4983 MCP-notify loop's shape -- but unconditional/global rather than
// per-session, since there is exactly one evaluator, not one per
// subscriber).
//
// Caches active trigger definitions (refreshed from Postgres via the
// DATA_API service binding's internal-only active-list route, #4984 Part 1)
// rather than querying Postgres per chain event -- evaluation must stay
// fast enough to never become the bottleneck in ChainFirehoseHub's
// broadcast() fan-out, which every OTHER consumer (SSE/WS/GraphQL/MCP)
// shares the same request with. A stale cache degrades gracefully (a
// brand-new trigger takes up to ALERTER_HUB_TRIGGER_CACHE_TTL_MS to start
// matching; a deleted one keeps matching for the same window) rather than
// adding a synchronous Postgres round-trip to every single chain event.
//
// Delivery (#4984 Part 3) is deliberately factored into src/alert-delivery.mjs
// (pure request-building, no I/O) + deliverAlertMatch below (the thin I/O
// shell that actually calls fetch) -- this class only decides WHICH
// triggers matched AND whether a match should actually be delivered right
// now (burst rate-limiting), never how each channel's request is shaped.
