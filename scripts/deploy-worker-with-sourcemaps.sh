#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Builds/publishes one of the 3 core Cloudflare Workers and uploads its
# source maps to the consolidated `metagraphed` Sentry project, so a captured
# error's minified stack trace (workers/*.sentry.mjs bundle, e.g.
# "api.sentry.js:18:8835") resolves to real source. wrangler.*.jsonc's own
# upload_source_maps only makes wrangler PRODUCE source maps as build
# output -- it does not push them into Sentry; that needs this explicit
# sentry-cli step reading the same output directory.
#
# The release value is generated once here (sentry-cli releases propose-
# version, git-derived) and passed to the build itself via --var, so the
# Worker's OWN release tag at runtime (env.SENTRY_RELEASE, read by workers/
# *.sentry.mjs's withSentry() options callback -- see that file's own header)
# is the exact same value the source maps get uploaded under. Previously the
# runtime release fell back to CF_VERSION_METADATA's UUID, which has no
# relationship to a git commit -- this also makes Sentry's suspect-commit
# detection actually work against the linked JSONbored/metagraphed repo.
#
# Two modes, matching the two Cloudflare Workers Builds command slots each of
# the 3 Worker projects has (Settings -> Build):
#   Deploy command:                      scripts/deploy-worker-with-sourcemaps.sh <config.jsonc>
#   Non-production branch deploy command: scripts/deploy-worker-with-sourcemaps.sh <config.jsonc> --preview
# --preview uses `wrangler versions upload` (a non-promoting version, not
# live traffic -- confirmed supported: --outdir/--upload-source-maps/--var
# all work identically on this subcommand, `wrangler versions upload --help`)
# instead of `wrangler deploy`, and tags the release/environment as preview
# so these don't get filed as production events or dilute suspect-commit
# data for a real release -- none of the 3 wrangler configs define a
# separate non-prod environment (wrangler.data.jsonc/wrangler.registry.jsonc
# even say so explicitly, "preview_urls: false"), so this is the one thing
# that keeps a branch build's errors distinguishable from production's
# despite sharing the exact same bindings/database.
#
# Needs SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN set as a Workers BUILD secret (not a runtime
# Variable/Secret -- sentry-cli only runs during the build, never reaches the
# deployed Worker) on each of the 3 Worker projects.
#
# --message also passed on the wrangler call itself (metagraphed#7224): the
# deployed commit SHA needs to land in the deployment's own real
# `workers/message` annotation (confirmed against Cloudflare's List
# Deployments API reference + wrangler's own CLI source -- `workers/message`/
# `workers/tag`/`workers/triggered_by` are the only Workers deployment
# annotations that actually exist; `workers/commit_hash` scripts/check-worker-
# deploy-drift.mjs previously checked was never a real one, that key only
# exists on Cloudflare Pages' unrelated deploy command) so that scheduled
# drift check can read the live commit directly instead of relying solely on
# its Sentry-release fallback.
#
# Usage: scripts/deploy-worker-with-sourcemaps.sh <wrangler-config.jsonc> [--preview]
