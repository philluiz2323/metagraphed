"""Classify a PR's validation route for CI (UGC submission vs full validation).

Reads ``changed-files.txt`` (one path per line, produced by the merge-base diff in
the classify-validation-route composite action) and decides:

  * ``mode=ugc``   — the PR is a single community candidate/provider submission
                     (registry/{candidates,providers}/community/<slug>.json). The
                     checks job runs the light submission preflight only.
  * ``mode=full``  — everything else. The full build + contract/schema/safety
                     suite runs (and the test job runs the test suite).

This is pure stdlib so it can run BEFORE ``npm ci`` (letting the test job skip
install for UGC PRs). It mirrors the canonical classifier in
``scripts/submission-policy.mjs`` (also exposed via ``scripts/ci-validate-route.mjs``);
keep the two in sync. Writes ``validate-route.json`` for debugging and appends
``mode``/``scope`` to ``$GITHUB_OUTPUT`` when present.
