// individually exceeded per-row tolerance after ~7h of staleness, entirely
// explained by ordinary network-wide staking activity, not a bug). A ratio
// scales with however stale Postgres happens to be and stays meaningful

// drift history to tune against -- scheduled to run shortly after
// refresh-metagraph's own daily fire (roles/data-refresh-node's job vars)
