"""Chain-direct event poller (#1346, epic #1345) — FIRST-PARTY, not Taostats.

Decodes SubtensorModule events from a recent window of FINALIZED finney blocks
via substrate-interface against PUBLIC RPC (no API key), normalizes the
entity-relevant ones to `account_events` rows, and writes JSON to
dist/account-events.json. The refresh-events workflow stages that to R2; the
Worker's loadStagedEvents bulk-loads it into D1 with INSERT OR IGNORE keyed
(block_number, event_index) — idempotent, so an overlapping window re-inserts
harmlessly.

Durable high-water cursor (#1346 audit fix): the scan no longer starts at a
FIXED `head - window`. The refresh-events workflow reads the last successfully
staged block from R2 (events/cursor.json) and passes it as EVENTS_CURSOR; we
scan `compute_from_block(cursor, head, window) .. head`. So a long gap (GitHub's
scheduler coalescing/dropping runs for longer than the window) is recovered from
the cursor instead of silently lost, while EVENTS_WINDOW stays as a generous
overlap floor that keeps a cold/empty cursor safe and the load idempotent. After
a successful stage the workflow advances the cursor to `events-cursor.json`
(the max block scanned this run, written below).

Run:  uv run --with substrate-interface python scripts/fetch-events.py
Env:  EVENTS_RPC_URL        public finney WS endpoint (default below)
      EVENTS_WINDOW         overlap floor: min blocks back from the finalized
                            head, even with a fresh cursor (default 256)
      EVENTS_CURSOR         highest block already staged (from R2); blank/absent
                            on a cold start → fall back to the window floor
      ACCOUNT_EVENTS_JSON   events output path (default dist/account-events.json)
      EVENTS_CURSOR_OUT     next-cursor sidecar path (default dist/events-cursor.json)

Positional attribute order verified against live finney (2026-06-21); see
src/account-events.mjs INDEXED_EVENT_KINDS for the loaded set. Extractors are
defensive: a shape that doesn't match (e.g. after a runtime upgrade) yields a
skipped event, never a corrupt row.
