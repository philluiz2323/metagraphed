    //     shared on-disk artifact trees in place: it rm's + repopulates the R2
    //     staging dir (dist/metagraph-r2/metagraph, where R2-only artifacts such
    //     as registry-summary.json live with NO committed public/metagraph
    //     fallback) and writeFileSyncs forged JSON into committed
    //     public/metagraph files before restoring them. Reader tests that serve
    //     those artifacts via createLocalArtifactEnv (subnet-overview,
    //     mcp-server, api-coverage, …) would otherwise race that rebuild and
    //     intermittently 404 (e.g. GET /api/v1/registry/summary -> 404 instead
    //     of 200). The build output root resolves from the script's own
    //     location, so it can't be redirected to a temp dir without a full
    //     input+output tree copy.
    //   - tests/public-safety.test.mjs writes a transient fixture into
    //     dist/metagraph-r2/metagraph/fixtures/ (to exercise
    //     scan-public-safety.mjs's mirroredFixturePatterns exemption) and
    //     deletes it in afterEach. scripts/validate-schemas.mjs treats that same
    //     directory as a templated artifact location and schema-validates every
    //     .json file in it, so a concurrently-running consumer of
    //     validate-schemas.mjs (e.g. tests/validate-error-messages.test.mjs) can
    //     read the fixture mid-write or after cleanup and throw ENOENT.
    // Serializing these files is the clean, low-risk fix. Per-file fork
    // isolation is preserved; only filesystem-race concurrency is removed.
    //
    // This serial default keeps a plain `npm test` / `npm run test:coverage`
    // (which runs the FULL suite, including the three filesystem-mutating
    // writers) race-free. CI instead runs the suite in two non-overlapping
    // passes that recover the parallelism: `test:ci` runs everything EXCEPT the
    // three writers with `--fileParallelism` (the createLocalArtifactEnv readers
    // only READ, so they parallelize safely once no writer runs alongside them)
    // and a raised `--testTimeout` (the subprocess-spawning tests — public-safety's
    // full-repo scan, script-utils, r2-upload — are CPU-starved under parallel
    // load and would otherwise hit the 5s default); `test:ci:artifacts` then runs
    // the three writers serially. The passes are sequential, so writers never
    // overlap readers. Coverage is collected only in `test:ci` (all three
    // writers drive their assertions primarily via execFileSync child
    // processes — build-artifacts.mjs for the first two, scan-public-safety.mjs
    // for the third — contributing zero in-process coverage there; none of the
    // three scripts are in the `include` globs below, so moving their tests to
    // the serial pass has no coverage effect either way — verified Δ=0.00
    // across all metrics), keeping CI to a single Codecov upload.
